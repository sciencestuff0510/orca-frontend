### How to Contribute

#### Setting Up Your Local Clone

Before you begin working on anything, make sure you follow these steps in order to set up a clone on your local machine:

1. Clone the repo in your local environment. If you don't know how to do so, follow the GitHub documentation on how to [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

2. Clone the forked repo to your local machine with one of the commands below. You can also read the GitHub documentation on [cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

    ```bash
    # If you have SSH set up with Git:
    git clone git@github.com:sciencestuff0510/orca-frontend.git
    # Otherwise for HTTPS:
    git clone https://github.com/sciencestuff0510/orca-frontend.git
    ```

3. `cd` into the directory of your local clone, remember to always pull the `main` branch before you branch out from it to continue working on other sections' respective branches.
